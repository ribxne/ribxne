# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a young living creature that goes by any/all pronouns

I like bricking Android devices and I want to learn more about breaking them

Maybe not a Linux fanatic but i like Arch and overall Arch-based distros (except Manjaro), Debian is neither bad nor good

I want to learn Rust, C/C++ (after learning Rust) and maybe Crystal/Ruby. I'm also keen on learning things about electronics

I hate cheese and JavaScript
